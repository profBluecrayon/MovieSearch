#### Details

2000-2020 movie search app.
Please note that all searches are case-sensitive.
Searches will only show top 10 searches and are indexed by title.
To avoid any self-setup, please use the provided link to test the app.
Built on create-react-app for simplicity.

#### Current Todo-List

- simplify updates after async requests
- find alternative to adding secrets in environment vars
- cache searches results on client
- convert project to typescript
- ^ look into fetching necessary types from themovie's Swagger page
- add analytics

#### Later Todo-List (not really necessary since not enough services/complexity that need to be managed)

- add language support (i18n-js)
- add redux
- add axios interceptors
- add feature flags
